Early diagnosis of breast cancer diagnosis has a significant impact on patient mortality rate. The diagnosis is usually done by analyzing the ultrasound, X-ray, CT-Scan, or MRI images captured from the breast tissue. This process is susceptible to human errors, and the high cost of error makes having a decision support tool necessary. This project is an effort to extract interpretable features from image data and use them to diagnose different types of tumors in breast tissue. Although usually techniques like convolutional neural networks (CNN) work better in the classification of image data, these techniques are not interpretable and cannot be easily used by medical experts. That is why we use decision trees to provide a model for tumor-type diagnosis in breast tissue. We extract similar features to the Wisconsinsin Breast Cancer Diagnosis Dataset (WBCD) from the BreakHis dataset using the Otsu threshold method. We used bagging to compensate for the data size limitations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time this method has been implemented in the literature. Our model provides promising results with around 80 percent accuracy in binary and 79 percent accuracy in multi-class classification.
